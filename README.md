# Rescue Basket

## Problem Statement

Food waste remains a pressing global concern, with an estimated one-third of all food produced being wasted. This leads to financial losses for businesses and significant environmental impact. Traditional methods of handling approaching-expiry food items often involve discarding them, creating missed opportunities for consumer savings and further financial loss for businesses.

## Proposed Solution

*Rescue Basket* is a web and mobile application that tackles food waste and bridges the gap between businesses and cost-conscious consumers through intelligent inventory management and automated rescue basket creation.

### Key Features

- **Automated Inventory Tracking and Expiry Monitoring:** Seamlessly integrates with existing point-of-sale (POS) systems to track inventory levels and expiry dates in real-time.
- **Dynamic "Rescue Basket" Creation:** Automatically generates rescue baskets containing discounted items as approaching-expiry items reach pre-set thresholds.
- **User-Friendly Marketplace:** Allows users to browse and purchase rescue baskets directly through the app, featuring clear information on contents, discounted price, store location, and environmental impact.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js:** For building the web application with server-side rendering.
- **PostgreSQL:** Database for storing inventory and user information.
- **Vercel:** Deployment platform for hosting the application.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **DrizzleORM:** Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for database interactions.

## Benefits

- **Reduced Food Waste and Increased Revenue:** Minimizes food waste for businesses and offers discounted items to consumers, leading to cost savings and increased revenue.
- **Discounted Groceries and Sustainable Consumption:** Provides high-quality food items at reduced prices, promoting responsible food consumption practices.
- **Sustainability and Environmental Impact:** Raises awareness of responsible consumption habits and reduces the environmental impact of the food industry.

## Additional Considerations

- **Loyalty Programs:** Encourages user retention with additional discounts or exclusive access to rescue baskets.
- **Geolocation Features:** Enables users to find nearby rescue baskets for optimal convenience.
- **Partnership Opportunities:** Collaborates with food banks or charities to donate leftover items nearing expiry.
